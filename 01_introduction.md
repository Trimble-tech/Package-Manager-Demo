# Linux Package Managers
If Linux is a penguin, then penguins may want igloos. Igloos need ice and blocks are a good way of transporting them.
Linux packages are the blocks that build the igloo.

Different distributions of Linux have different ways of carrying those blocks. It is a story as old as time:
```
On the first day, a college student said "let there be the kernel".
On a forum some time later, people said "let there be source code".
After waiting a long time for software to compile on each machine, users said "let there be packages".
```
There are different ways to go about packaging code. The package itself typically resembles something like a .Zip file with a different extension and a particular set of contents (primarily compiled code). We will focus on the software used to manage these packages on popular systems.
