# Exercises
Here are some ideas for experimenting with a package manager.
These can be done with whichever Linux you are running.
If you have time and resources, try this with different distributions.

Refer to `03_basic_commands.md`  or `04_sandboxed_packages.md` if you are stuck.

1. Update the package cache to see if there are new updates or packages.
2. Search for a package.
3. Install a package.
4. Remove a package.
5. If you have a containerized package manager like Flatpak or Snap, try repeating these steps on in that package manager. Are there differences?
